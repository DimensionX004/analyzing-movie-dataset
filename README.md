### Project Overview

 The best project to do before going onto Pandas and NumPy.


### Learnings from the project

 Learnt a lot about 2D array.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I took help from the GreyAtom forum and the internet to complete the code. 


### Challenges faced

 I didn't have the idea about a list within a list, which is an application of a 2D array.


### Additional pointers

 First I faced a lot of issues that slowly got away when I got the concept of a 2D array.
